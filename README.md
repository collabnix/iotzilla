# IoTZilla

We are aiming to bring the IoT community together, complete hands-on labs, build a largest IoT Cluster and showcase it on IoT Workshop Day.


## Why are we doing this?

It's great opportunity for community members to learn, collaborate and contribute around IoT and related technologies. As a team, we will learn how  IoT  works, how cluster is setup, how apps gets deployed over IoT and what kind of cool IoT projects can be run possibly on these tiny IoT nodes. Community members will learn how monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana can be deployed and fetch time-series metrics out of these HUGE cluster of nodes. In nutshell, it's 7 hour effort which will let every single individual to learn and run hands-on  IoT projects  and understand its capabilities.


## When? 

> We are targeting 18th Feb starting 9:00 AM till 4:00 PM for IoT Workshop.
